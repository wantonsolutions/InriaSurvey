\section{ Predicate Detection for Parallel Computation with Locking Constraints \\ \small{Yen-Jung Chang, Vijay K. Garag}}

\subsection{Notes}

Initially this paper proposes an analysis techinique which analyzes an
exponential number of posets in order to check if locking predicates hold. It
seems as if it is going to build posets out of code itself.

\textbf{After getting through the first 5 pages I was very lost. This paper it seems is too theoretical for me. \todo{Return to this paper after reading ~15 more theoretical papers by Garag}}
